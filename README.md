Trouble 

Instructions: 

⦁	2-4 players needed to play: Type 3 zeros if you have more than 1 player to make the game start.

⦁	Every player has been given a name: Each player is named by a color red, blue, green and yellow, but R, Y, G  and B for short.

⦁	Goal of the game is to get 4 of your pieces to home: To start first player rolls a die and if he rolls a 5 for example then the piece moves 5 times to the left. When piece reaches home than repeat with all the other pieces. First one to get all the pieces to home wins.

⦁ To make it less complicated I am not adding the rule where you roll 6 and you decide if you want to move the other piece or not. Instead you keep using that piece until it hits home.

⦁	Try to explain this more detailed in the program.



Planning:

⦁	Create the board using 2D arrays and make it 7x7.

⦁ Creating a 6 integer die that rolls a random number

⦁	Now im going to put the given names in each of the 4 corners.( Y,G,R and B)

⦁	Instead of putting 4 pieces as 4 letters im going to put one letter and once that piece moves from the starting position, lets say my player is B, then the other piece name will change to B2. Then when B1 hits home and its time for B2 to reach home , and once  B2 leaves from the staring position then the other piece name will be B3 and so on. 

⦁ Now im going initialise all the characters into the program. 

⦁And ofcourse try to make the letters move after die rolled.
